Ice Cream Shop Order Simulation
Introduction

This code is a JavaScript simulation of an ice cream shop's order and production process. It uses Promises and setTimeout to mimic the steps involved in serving a customer at the shop.
How It Works

    Initialization:
        The is_shop_open variable is set to true, indicating that the ice cream shop is open.

    Order Function:
        The order function takes two arguments: time (time delay) and work (a callback function).
        It returns a Promise that simulates order processing.
        If the shop is open (is_shop_open is true), the function schedules the provided work callback to be executed after the specified time delay using setTimeout.
        If the shop is closed, it rejects the Promise with the message "Our shop is closed."

    Ordering Process:
        The code simulates a customer's order and the production of an ice cream cone with various steps.
        Each step (e.g., selecting fruits, starting production, selecting liquids) is represented by a .then block, which chains together a series of asynchronous operations.
        Promises are used to ensure that each step completes before moving on to the next one.

    Error Handling:
        If any Promise is rejected (e.g., due to the shop being closed), the code handles the error using the catch block and displays an error message.

    Completion:
        The finally block is executed regardless of whether the Promises are resolved or rejected. It displays a message indicating the end of the day and that the shop is closed.

How to Run the Code

To run this code on your system, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository to your local machine.

    Open the HTML file containing this code in a web browser.

    The code will execute, simulating the ice cream shop order process, and the output will be displayed in the browser's console or directly on the web page.
